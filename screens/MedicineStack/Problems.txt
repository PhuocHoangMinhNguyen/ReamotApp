Problem 1: repeat_interval

Problem 1: When the alarm is stopped using stopAlarmSound(), "update" is set to ''

Problem 2: Modifying Alarm in Change Reminder is having problem (Need closer look into the problem)
 - Doesnt delete the previous alarm before setting a new one (fixed)
 - Doesnt save idAN attribute in Firestore (fixed)
 - fireDate and testDate are not the same

Problem 3: Need to add requirement that the remiders of the same medicine need to be at least one hour gap from each other

Problem 4: Need to add condition if the input time is before the current time.

Main Problem: interval is set as 1, regardless of "repeat_interval" value.

Debug 1: alarm_id cannot be 0 because due to ANModule.java in ReactNativeAN,
if alarm_id <= 0, it will be set as System.currentTimeMillis();

Debug 2: deleteAlarm() is not working correctly, it takes argument as "id" instead of "alarm_id"

Solution 1: deleteAlarm() fixed

Solution 2: scheduleAlarm() in ChangeReminder somehow fixed
