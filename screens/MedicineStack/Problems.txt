Problem 1: stopAlarm just snoozes the alarm instead of actually stopping it.
( Need a closer look into the problem )

Problem 2: When the alarm is stopped using stopAlarmSound(), "update" is set to ''

Main Problem: deleteAlarm() function is written incorrectly by ReactNativeAN Authors.
 - deleteAlarm() argument should be "alarm_id" instead of "id"
 ==> Waiting for author correction.

New Problem: interval is set as 1, regardless of "repeat_interval" value.

Debug 1: alarm_id cannot be 0 because due to ANModule.java in ReactNativeAN,
if alarm_id <= 0, it will be set as System.currentTimeMillis();
