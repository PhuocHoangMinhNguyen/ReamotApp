Problem 1: stopAlarm just snoozes the alarm instead of actually stopping it.
( Need a closer look into the problem )

Problem 2: alarm Id is stored incorrectly in ReactNativeAN
 - It supposes to be 0 but turns out to be 1.
 - The alarm sometimes works when 2 alarms are set 
    (Need closer look into the problem)
 - However, the id is stored correctly in Firestore

Problem 3: When the alarm is deleted, "update" is set to ''
 - Instead, "update" supposes to just only delete the deleted alarm,
    leaving the non-deleted alarms appear (Optional)

Problem 4: The library author has "alarmId" and "id" attributes.
 - Need to find the differences.

Debug 1: alarm_id cannot be 0 because due to ANModule.java in ReactNativeAN,
if alarm_id <= 0, it will be set as System.currentTimeMillis();
