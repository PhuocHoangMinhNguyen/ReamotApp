Problem 1 (Found Work Around): deleteAlarm function in react-native-alarm-notification package wont delete the alarm but set it as Inactive 
    ==> if alarm_id is the same as pre-set alarm, it wont be set.
    ==> Cannot be fixed, one work around as setting alarm_id using Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) function.

Problem 2 (4/10): ChangeReminder.js ==> Cannot find ID with time
