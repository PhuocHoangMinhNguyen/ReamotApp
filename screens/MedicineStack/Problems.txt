Problem 1: stopAlarm just snoozes the alarm instead of actually stopping it.
( Need a closer look into the problem )

Problem 2: alarm Id is stored incorrectly in ReactNativeAN
 - It supposes to be 0 but turns out to be 1.
 - The alarm sometimes works when 2 alarms are set 
    (Need closer look into the problem)
 - However, the id is stored correctly in Firestore

Problem 3: When the alarm is deleted, "update" is set to ''
 - Instead, "update" supposes to just only delete the deleted alarm,
    leaving the non-deleted alarms appear (Optional)
