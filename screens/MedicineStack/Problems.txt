Problem 1: repeat_interval

Problem 2: Modifying Alarm in Change Reminder is having problem (Need closer look into the problem)
 - Doesnt delete the previous alarm before setting a new one (fixed)
 - Doesnt save idAN attribute in Firestore (fixed)
 - fireDate and testDate are not the same

Problem 3: Need to add requirement that the remiders of the same medicine need to be at least one hour gap from each other

Problem 4: Need to add condition if the input time is before the current time.

Main Problem: interval is set as 1, regardless of "repeat_interval" value.

Debug 1: alarm_id cannot be 0 because due to ANModule.java in ReactNativeAN,
if alarm_id <= 0, it will be set as System.currentTimeMillis();

Debug 2: deleteAlarm() is not working correctly, it takes argument as "id" instead of "alarm_id"

Solution 1: deleteAlarm() fixed

Solution 2: scheduleAlarm() in ChangeReminder somehow fixed

Main Problem: Delete Alarm Bugging (Need a closer look)
    - More details: 
        - If the new alarm has the same alarm_id as the deleted one, it wont be set.
        - Instead of deleting the alarm, the package set the active value of the alarm as "off"
        ==> If the new alarm has the same time as the "off" alarm, the alarm wont be set
        ==> Already has a new request to fix it on Github. ==> Waiting for response.
    - Reason: Havent found
    - Solution:
        - Solution 1 - Failed: Try to use stopAlarmSound instead of deleteAlarm
        - Solution 2: Need to update the idAN in Firebase

Problem 1: The alarm currently reset after every "loop" starting from the time the alarm is turned off.
            It should start from the time the alarm is set instead.
Problem 2: Should implement Click on Notification
